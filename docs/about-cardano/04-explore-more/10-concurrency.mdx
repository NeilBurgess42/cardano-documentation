Concurrency refers to the ability of different actors to perform work simultaneously without interfering with each other. In Cardano's Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model, transactions can be processed in parallel, enabling multiple operations without causing system failures. This approach enhances system throughput while maintaining the performance of individual operations.

The EUTXO model, employed by Cardano, allows for secure and predictable execution of smart contracts. By splitting logic across different branches and utilizing multiple UTXOs, Cardano achieves greater parallelism, leading to improved scalability.

The level of concurrency sets the limit for simultaneous operations. Developers should adopt strategies to minimize contention and translate concurrency into parallelism, which may involve a learning curve but yields significant benefits.
