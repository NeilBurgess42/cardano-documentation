[Cardano](https://cardano.org/) is an open source
[proof-of-stake](/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/proof-of-stake) blockchain
project that began in 2015 to address existing blockchain challenges in the
design and development of cryptocurrencies. It aims to provide a more balanced
and sustainable ecosystem that better accounts for the needs of its users as
well as other systems seeking integration.

The first generation of blockchains (like Bitcoin) offered decentralized ledgers
for secure cryptocurrency transfer. However, such blockchains did not provide a
functional environment for complex deal settlement and decentralized application
(DApp) development. As blockchain technology matured, the second generation
(like Ethereum) provided more enhanced solutions for writing and executing smart
contracts, application development, and the creation of different token types.
On the other hand, the second generation of blockchains often faces issues in
terms of scalability.

Cardano is conceived as the third-generation blockchain as it combines the
properties of the prior generations and evolves to meet all the arising needs of
users. When comparing blockchain properties, many aspects should be considered.
Thus, the best solution must ensure the highest security, scalability
(transaction throughput, data scale, network bandwidth), and functionality
(besides transaction processing, the blockchain should provide all means for
business deal settlement). Moreover, it is important to ensure that blockchain
technology is constantly developing in terms of sustainability and is
interoperable with other blockchains and financial institutions.

To address these needs, Cardano has been built focusing on such core concepts
as:

- **Scalability** – ensures that the Cardano network is capable of processing an
  increasing number of transactions as user demand grows. Scalability also
  provides higher bandwidth capabilities to allow transactions to carry a
  significant amount of supportive data that can be easily managed within the
  network. For these needs, Cardano is implementing various techniques (like
  data compression for instance), and introduces such scaling solutions as
  [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/) and
  [Mithril](https://mithril.network/doc/), for example. Read more about the
  [research underpinning Cardano's scalability here](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/an-analysis-of-the-research-underpinning-cardanos-scalability).
- **Interoperability** – ensures the most multi-functional environment for
  financial, business, or commercial operations by enabling users to interact
  with different blockchain systems. Cardano aims to support cross-chain
  transfers, multiple token types, and commonly used smart contract languages.

  [partner chains](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/11/03/partner-chains-are-coming-to-cardano/).
- **Sustainability** – designing a proof-of-stake blockchain means it is vital
  to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. To drive growth and maturity in
  a truly decentralized manner, Cardano is built to allow the community to
  maintain its continuous development by participating, proposing, and
  implementing system improvements. This is now being implemented through
  [CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694) on-chain governance
  mechanisms.

## Cardano advantages

- **Academic research** – formal methods, such as mathematical specifications,
  property-based tests, and proofs, are the best way to deliver high assurance
  software systems and give confidence to users for the management of digital
  funds. Cardano has been built using formal methods to achieve strong
  guarantees on the functional correctness of core components of the system. All
  of the research and technical specifications that underpin Cardano are
  publicly available, and all Cardano development activity is published online.
- **System design** – Cardano is written in Haskell, a secure functional
  programming language that encourages building a system using pure functions,
  which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in
  isolation. Advanced features of Haskell enable employing a whole range of
  powerful methods for ensuring code correctness, such as basing the
  implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive
  property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.
- **Security** –
  [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/)
  (the Cardano proof-of-stake protocol) establishes rigorous security
  guarantees; it was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in
  top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and
  cryptography.
- **Energy efficiency** – Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain. In contrast to
  proof-of-work blockchains,
  [Cardano requires much less energy](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/17/why-they-re-calling-cardano-the-green-blockchain/)
  and computational power. The Bitcoin network is secured through computers
  doing ever-more-energy-intensive computations – proof of work – which is
  unsustainable in the long term. Cambridge University has an online tool that
  shows the [computers powering Bitcoin](https://cbeci.org/) already consume
  more electricity than some countries, like
  [Switzerland](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home/supply/statistics-and-geodata/energy-statistics/overall-energy-statistics.html)
  for example.
- **Seamless upgrades** – traditionally, blockchains upgrade using hard forks.
  When conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating, new
  rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart – with its
  previous history being erased. Cardano handles hard forks differently. Instead
  of implementing radical changes, the Cardano
  [hard fork combinator technology](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/05/07/combinator-makes-easy-work-of-shelley-hard-fork/)
  ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol while saving the history of the
  previous blocks and not causing any disruptions for end users.
- **Decentralization** – Cardano is maintained by over 3,000 distributed stake
  pools that are operated by the community. All blocks and transactions are
  validated by network participants without any reliance on a centralized
  authority.
- **Functional environment for business use cases** – Cardano is establishing a
  foundation for global, decentralized finance to develop a range of DApps that
  can run using functional and domain-specific smart contracts, providing
  multi-asset tokens for any needs.
