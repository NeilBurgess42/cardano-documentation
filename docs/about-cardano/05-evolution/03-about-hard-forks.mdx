The term _hard fork_ describes a radical change in the blockchain: a change from
one protocol to another, for example. In most blockchains, a hard fork
indicates block changes or a change to their interpretation. 

Traditionally, when conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating,
new rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart. It is important to
note that a hard-forked chain _will be different_ from the previous version and
that the history of the pre-forked blockchain will no longer be available.

The Cardano blockchain hard forked from a Byron federated model to
a Shelley decentralized one in 2020. However, this hard fork was unique. Instead of
implementing radical changes, Cardano ensured a smooth transition to a new protocol
while saving the history of the previous blocks. This means that the chain did
not change *radically*, instead, it contained Byron blocks, and after a transition
period, added Shelley blocks. There was no fundamental restart point that erased
the history of previous activities.

## What is a hard fork combinator?

A combinator is a technical term used to indicate the combination of certain
processes or things. In the case of Cardano, a hard fork combinator combines
protocols, thereby enabling the [era-to-era transition](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/29/from-byron-to-shelley-part-one-the-testnets/) without system
interruption or restart. It ensured that Byron and Shelley ledgers appeared as *one*
ledger. Shifting from [Ouroboros BFT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1049.pdf) to [Ouroboros Praos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-praosan-adaptively-securesemi-synchronous-proof-of-stake-protocol/) did not require all nodes to
update simultaneously. Instead, nodes could update gradually, in fact, some could
run Byron blocks, while others could run Shelley blocks.

The hard fork combinator is designed to enable the combination of several
protocols, without having to make significant adjustments.
