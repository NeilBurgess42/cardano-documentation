metaTitle: Mary - multi-asset support
---

_Mary_ is the Shelley protocol upgrade implemented in March 2021. It introduced
native token and multi-asset support on Cardano. Mary allowed users to create
uniquely defined (custom) tokens and carry out transactions with them directly
on the Cardano blockchain.

With the Mary upgrade, the ledgerâ€™s accounting infrastructure processes not only
ada transactions but also transactions that simultaneously carry several asset
types. Native support grants distinct advantages for developers as there is no
need to create smart contracts to handle custom token creation or transactions.
Instead, the accounting ledger tracks the ownership and transfer of assets,
removing extra complexity and potential for manual errors, while ensuring
significant cost efficiency.

Developers, businesses, and applications can create general purpose (fungible)
or specialized (non-fungible) tokens to achieve commercial or business
objectives. These might include the creation of custom payment tokens or rewards
for decentralized applications; stablecoins pegged to other currencies; or
unique assets that represent intellectual property. All these assets can then be
traded, exchanged, or used as payment for products or services.
