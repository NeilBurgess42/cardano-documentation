Welcome to the central hub for Cardano documentation. Here, you'll find content
that describes and supports the features on both the Cardano mainnet and testnet
environments.

This includes basic explainers for newcomers to Cardano, explanations of the
core features, details about Cardano's design and evolution, insights into how
the Cardano network operates, and platform architecture. You can also access
developer resources that explain the core concepts and provide links to
developer documentation for more technical tutorials.

If you are interested in building tools on Cardano, integrating with Cardano,
and connecting with the wider developer community, please visit the
[Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/home/).

## Cardano explained

Cardano is a decentralized third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform
and home to the ada cryptocurrency. It is the first blockchain platform to
evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach.

The Cardano platform has been designed from the ground up and verified by an
industry-leading combination of top engineers and academic experts in the fields
of blockchain and cryptography. It has a strong focus on sustainability,
scalability, and transparency. It is a fully open source project that aims to
deliver an inclusive, fair, and resilient infrastructure for financial and
social applications on a global scale. One of its primary goals is to bring
reliable, secure financial services to those people who do not currently have
access.

Cardano has been designed with security as one of its founding principles. It is
written in Haskell, a functional programming language. In a functional language
like Haskell, building your system using pure functions is encouraged, which
leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in isolation.
Furthermore, advanced features of Haskell enable employing a whole range of
powerful methods for ensuring the correctness of the code, such as basing the
implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive property-based
testing, and running tests in simulation.

Cardano's smart contract platform seeks to deliver more advanced features than
any protocol previously developed and will serve as a stable and secure platform
for the development of enterprise-level DApps. Cardano's democratic governance
system, being implemented based on
[CIP-1694](https://cips.cardano.org/cip/CIP-1694) on-chain governance
mechanisms, will enable the project to evolve over time and sustainably fund
itself through a visionary treasury system.
