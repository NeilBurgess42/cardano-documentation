Since Cardano is a public blockchain ledger, it is possible to easily track all
recent transactions, block details, and epoch data using different tools.

## Exploring transactions and blocks

**Cardano Explorer**

[Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en) is a user-oriented tool that
fetches data from the main database and reflects it in a straightforward and
convenient web interface.

The explorer shows the latest epoch details. You can click the latest epoch and
see:

- a number of blocks produced during this epoch
- time the epoch started
- time of last produced block
- number of processed transactions
- total output in ada.

By choosing a specific block, you can explore it in more detail to see its ID,
size, epoch and block details, number of included transactions and
confirmations.

You can also search for specific epochs, transactions, or blocks by pasting their
IDs in the search field.

Here are some other explorers to consider:

- [AdaStat](https://adastat.net/transactions)
- [Cardanoscan](https://cardanoscan.io/transactions)
- [Cexplorer](https://cexplorer.io/)

## Exploring assets

Cardano supports multi-asset creation and management. To see a list of created
assets and tokens, you can use these tools:

- [AdaStat (tokens)](https://adastat.net/tokens)
- [Cardano Assets](https://cardanoassets.com/)
- [Cardanoscan (tokens)](https://cardanoscan.io/tokens)
- [Pool.pm (tokens)](https://pool.pm/tokens)
- [Cexplorer (tokens)](https://cexplorer.io/token)

## Exploring stake pools

To find a list of all registered stake pools, their tickers, pool names, and
IDs, you can use these tools:

- [Cardano PoolTool](https://pooltool.io/)
- [Cardanoscan (pools)](https://cardanoscan.io/pools)
- [Pool.pm (pools)](https://pool.pm/search)
