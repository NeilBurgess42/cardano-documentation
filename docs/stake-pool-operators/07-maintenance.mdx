After a successful stake pool registration and its further operation, SPOs might
be interested in obtaining certain information about their poolsâ€™ activity.
Information about those pools that are operating on mainnet can be fetched using
different explorer tools. See
[introduction](/stake-pool-operators/01-operating-a-stake-pool.mdx) for useful
resources.

In certain cases, exchanges and stake pool operators, in particular, are looking
for in-depth information about their mainnet _and_ testnet pools. To access data
that is stored on the Cardano blockchain, it is recommended to use
[cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node),
[cardano-db-sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync), or
[cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql).

Each of the above integration components can be installed and easily deployed
using Docker.
