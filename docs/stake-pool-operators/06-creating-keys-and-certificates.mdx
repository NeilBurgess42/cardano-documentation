## About the stake pool operator keys

It is the responsibility of the operator to manage both the hot (online), and
cold (offline) keys for the pool. Cold keys must be secure and should not reside
on a device that has internet connectivity. It is recommended that you have
multiple backups of your cold keys.

The keys that you need as a stake pool operator are:

- stake pool cold key
- stake pool hot key (KES key)
- stake pool VRF key.

The KES key, or hot key as mentioned above, is a node operational key that
authenticates who you are. You specify the validity of the KES key using the
start time and key period parameters and this KES key needs to be updated every
90 days. The VRF key is a signing verification key and is stored within the
operational certificate.

## Creating an operational certificate and registering a stake pool

Stake pool operators must provide an operational certificate to verify that the
pool has the authority to run. The certificate includes the operator’s signature
and important information about the pool (addresses, keys, etc.)

Operational certificates represent the link between the operator’s offline key
and their operational key. A certificate’s job is to check whether or not an
operational key is valid, to prevent malicious interference. The certificate
identifies the current operational key, and is signed by the offline key.

Certificates are generated with an issue counter number and included in the
header of each block the node generates. 

Certificates include a kes-period (start date), which indicates the period
within which the certificate is valid before you need to create another one.

Certificates are generated on the offline machine using the offline/cold keys,
before being copied over to the node to validate the KES keys used to sign the
blocks.
