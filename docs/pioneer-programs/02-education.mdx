## IO initiatives

Education is a cornerstone of fostering a knowledgeable and engaged global community. By prioritizing education, IO aims to share its expertise and empower individuals to contribute meaningfully to the Cardano ecosystem. Whether you're a developer, an academic, or a business professional, IO educational offerings are designed to equip you with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the blockchain space.

The team brings together extensive experience in curriculum design, project management, and the technical intricacies of Cardano, Haskell, and smart contracts. This collective skill set ensures that educational programs are comprehensive, practical, and tailored to diverse learners' needs.

## Collaborations

The IO education team has collaborations with various universities and educational institutions worldwide to deliver high-quality education, including:

-   [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where there is a blockchain laboratory run by IO’s chief scientist, [Prof Aggelos Kiayias](https://iohk.io/en/leadership/aggelos-kiayias), and his research team
-   [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/)
-   [University of West Indies](https://www.uwi.edu/)
-   [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu/index.html)
-   [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)
-   [European Business University of Luxembourg](https://ebulux.lu/)
-   [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/)
-   [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx)

Additionally, the team has worked on curriculum design for blockchain programs with Yeovil College in the UK and Consilium Academy in South Africa.

## Course offerings

### Mission-based education

-   **Cardano Days**: interactive events providing a deep dive into the Cardano platform, covering its unique features and applications.
-   **Mastering Cardano**: comprehensive book designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the Cardano blockchain. This work is in progress, so stay tuned for updates.

The education team has held several Cardano Day events across different locations:

-   [ITESO University](https://www.iteso.mx/en/), Guadalajara, Mexico
-   [University of Celaya,](https://www.udec.edu.mx/en/) Guanajuato, Mexico
-   [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/), Valletta Campus, Valletta, Malta
-   [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu/index.html), Laramie, USA.
-   [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx), Santander, Spain

    
These events cover the basics of blockchain technology, Cardano, and smart contracts and prove very popular, with a typical NPS score of 92.

More events are continually planned, and if you would like to know more about hosting a Cardano Days event, please [get in touch](mailto:education@iohk.io).

### Developer education

-   [Cardano Developer course](https://github.com/iog-edu-argentina-2024/cardano-dev-2024): a program to train developers in building smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano platform.
-   [Plutus Pioneer program](https://docs.cardano.org/pioneer-programs/plutus-pioneers/): focuses on Plutus, Cardano’s smart contract platform, offering hands-on experience in writing and deploying smart contracts.
-   [DRep Pioneer program](https://sancho.network/drep-pioneer-program/drep-pp/overview): prepares participants to become delegate representatives, playing a crucial role in Cardano’s governance.
-   [Haskell Bootcamp](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course?tab=readme-ov-file#haskell-course): an immersive self-paced Haskell course. This course provides a stepping stone for people to upskill on Haskell before enrolling in the Plutus Pioneer program. It consists of videos and interactive lessons and has received positive feedback and engagement.
-   **Hackathons**: support for hackathons in universities and at various blockchain events. Previous hackathons have been held in Mongolia, the USA, and Argentina.


### Internal training

-   **Plutus internal training**: based on the Plutus Pioneer program, this course offers insights into the core smart contract functionality.
-   **IO Maths Academy**: basic category theory course, which teaches how to build stronger code with mathematical precision to gain knowledge about the functional approach to mathematics. The advanced course is planned for release in 2025.
    
### Academic and business collaborations

IO also engages in academic and business collaborations, offering specialized lectures and workshops on blockchain and Cardano. These programs bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, fostering innovation and real-world problem-solving skills.

Some example initiatives include:

-   Smart contract lectures (virtual and in-person) at the [University of Malta](https://www.um.edu.mt/)
-   Cardano Developer course with the [National Technological University](https://utn.edu.ar/es/) in Buenos Aires.
