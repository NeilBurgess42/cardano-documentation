import Faucet from '../../../src/components/Faucet'

Since Cardano testnets are independent networks, separate from the Cardano
mainnet, they require their own tokens.

The faucet is a web-based service that provides test ada to users of the Cardano
testnets. While these tokens have no 'real world' value, they enable users to
experiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real ada on
the mainnet.

**To request tokens using the faucet:**

1. Select the desired action type:
   - Enter the account address where you want to top up funds
   - Enter the pool ID in bech32 format (`pool18ttg8k...a1c`) where you want to
     delegate funds
2. If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any
   additional funds you may have been allocated
3. Click **Receive test ada**
4. Funds will be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes.

**Delegation**

If you're an SPO and wish to test stake pool operations on preview or
pre-production testnets, you can request some test ada to be delegated to your
pool. For this, choose the environment you're working in, and select 'receive
pool delegation' from the action menu.

_When you have finished using your test tokens, please return them to the faucet
so that other members of the community can use them. You can return your test
tokens to the relevant address:_
