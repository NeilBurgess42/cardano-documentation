Cardano testnets sit at the vanguard of network development, providing sandboxed
environments for continuing innovation, harnessing the power of the Cardano
community to iterate and improve.

Stake pool operators, exchanges, smart contract developers, and projects can
engage with different early-stage and pre-production networks to actively test
core Cardano functionality prior to deploying on mainnet.

Discover the various testnet environments available on Cardano to select the one
best suited for your testing needs.

## Early-stage testing networks

### SanchoNet

SanchoNet is an early-stage testnet environment for testing CIP-1694 on-chain
governance mechanisms.

### Preview

Preview is the network environment for testing release candidates and expanded
test scenarios. Preview is meant for DApps, stake pool operators (SPOs), and
exchanges who wish to test mature release candidates.

## Late-stage testing networks

### Pre-production

Pre-production is the most mature network for testing purposes, which resembles
a production (mainnet) environment. It is meant for exchanges, SPOs,
pre-deployment DApps, and wallets that wish to test release functionality before
deploying on mainnet.

### Production network (mainnet)

Production is the live network, also referred to as mainnet. It features
official functionality releases. Exchanges, SPOs, DApps, wallets, and end users
can use the mainnet for development, transaction processing, and other needs.
