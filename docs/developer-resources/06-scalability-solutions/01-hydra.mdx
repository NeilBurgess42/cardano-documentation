Hydra is a layer 2 scaling solution for Cardano rooted in peer-reviewed research that increases transaction throughput and ensures cost efficiency while maintaining rigorous security.

Hydra Head is the first protocol of the Hydra family of protocols, which
embodies the foundation for more advanced deployment scenarios relying on
isomorphic, multi-party state channels. Each Hydra Head works as an off-chain
mini ledger shared between a small group of participants. Developers can use
Hydra Heads to add specialized, complex protocols on top of Cardano.
